# Information Retrieval from RC Images Using AWS Textract API

Extracting useful information from any raw text is a difficult task but in this project, we are retrieving the in-formation from an image with the help of AWS Textract which gives its output as tokenized or blocked raw text which will be further reduced to useful information with the help of rule based matching or object based matching. As dataset we are using 46 sample images of RCs which is stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
